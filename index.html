            <p>My name is Mason Sain. I am currently working on my Bachelors in Software Development at Green River College. I have previously obtained my associates in cybersecurity at Green River as well. A hobby of mine is to help out friends create small games within a set time period. These time periods are short and last under a week. Other than that, I enjoy music, video games, traveling, and more.

            <p>My name is Jennifer McNiel. I am  the Bachelorâ€™s in Software
                Development at Green River College. I have worked at Alaska
                Airlines for 5 years. I started as an airport customer service
                agent and then moved into a QA Test role about 4 years ago.
                I have 5 children so I stay busy getting kids to activities.
                Gavin is 21, Kaemon is 19, Allison and Lauren are 13 and Ian
                is 10. We are originally from the Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas area.
                When I have free time I love reading science fiction and fantasy,
                playing video games, table top gaming and watching anime with my kids.</p>

            <p>My name is Matt Miss. I am in my third year of the Bachelor's in Software Development program at Green
                River College. I started programming about 6 years ago while learning to make video games in Unity. In
                my free time I make games, record music, and sell cosplay ideas I create. I have been married for 7
                years and have 3 cats. I like to read a lot of sci-fi and horror and have lived in the Pacific Northwest
                my entire life.</p>

            <p>Hello, my name is Yadira Cervantes. I earned my associate's degree at Highline College through the
                running start program, and I'm currently enrolled in the software development program at Greenriver
                College. One of my hobbies is drawing. In particular, I like to draw portraits with graphite but I have
                dabbled in digital art and other mediums. A lot of my time outside of school is spent with my nephew and
                niece who definitely keep me on my toes.</p>
